# python environment creator

I have used the [suggestion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6323860/sibling-package-imports) provided by user [evpok](https://stackoverflow.com/users/760767/evpok) to form python projects for a long time.

This script creates the folder structure, virtual environment etc.
